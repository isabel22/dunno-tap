# dunno-tap
DunnoTap is a board game based on the Whac-A-Mole game. DunnoTap's board has nine wooden boxes. Each box will rotate one at a time; when a box rotates, it can show you one of these icons:
- Golden bar (will give you points when you tap over it)
- Axe (will get you points out when you tap over it)

You have time and a minimum score to complete each level. The higher the level, the fastest the box rotates (in and out).

This game was implemented with Unity, C# and <3.
